# Configure Crostini with Ansible
Getting back into using my chromebook, and I've always wanted to play with Ansible.

### Copy and paste this in your Terminal:
```
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y && sudo apt -y install git && git clone https://github.com/Francommit/crostini-ansible.git && cd crostini-ansible
```
